The essence of 8bit music
----------------------------------------------------
8bit music, or chiptune music, is synthesized electronic music produced by the sound chips computers and video game consoles.
As these latter machines could only produce simple waveforms some decades ago the music had certain limitations: it did not resemble any real-life instruments very well. Still, 8bit music has the power to express emotions like any type acoustic music. 
What can the characteristics of certain 8bit compositions tell us about the essentials of music?

In this game, inspired by 'Hooked on Music', players choose which game scene they think matches the music playing in the background. Each round gives four options (gif images) where a player can select the segment he/she thinks is compatible. 

As the game develops combinations appear where there are no 'correct' answers available. What can we say about the given answers in these situations? Is there any resemblance in the chosen segment and the actual segment that the music refered to? If yes, does this mean that the composer succeeded in capturing a certain objective truth in the music, like 'scary', 'happy', 'fighting' or 'vitory'? 

This code in this project was based on 'Battlecat', created at the UvA hackathlon in May. Robert-Jan has since then helped me enormously with writing the right syntax for react.js. The project contains a pagination with different images and sounds for each round.
For future work it would be great to write a funciton which allows me to see what people actually answered.
