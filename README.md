The essence of 8bit music
----------------------------------------------------
8bit music, or chiptune music, is synthesized electronic music produced by the sound chips computers and video game consoles.
As these latter machines could only produce simple waveforms the music had certain limitations: the sound it produced did not 
resemble any real-life instruments very well. Still, 8bit music has the power to express emotions like any type acoustic music. 
What can  the characteristics of certain 8bit compositions tell us about the essentials of music?

In this game, inspired by 'Hooked on Music', players choose which game matches the music playing in the background. Each round
gives four scenes from games which (moving gif images) where a player can select the segment he/she thinks is most suitable for 
the game. 

As the game develops combinations appear where there are no 'correct' answers available: the music playing in the background is 
not from any of the samples. What can we say about the scenes that a player chooses in this situation? Is there any resemblance 
to the actual game that the music refers to? Does this mean that the composer succeeded in showcasing a certain objective truth
in his/her music, like 'scary', 'happy' or 'angry'? And if that is the case, can we pinpoint these qualities to certain elements
of the composition such as harmony, melody and rhythm?

This code was based on the 'Battlecat project', created at the hackathlon in May. Robert-Jan has since then helped me enormously 
in writing the right syntax for react.js in order to reach what I wanted. The project contains a pagination with all the refered 
media set up in the entry.jsx file. 
For future work it would be great to write a funciton that allows me to see what people actually answered.
